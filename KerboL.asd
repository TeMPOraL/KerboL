  :description "A Lisp interface and script compiler for Kerbal Operating System (kOS)."
  :long-description "KerboL, short from Kerbo-Lisp, is a set of tools for Kerbal Operating System mod.
It contains (or rather, will contain):
- a Telnet client connecting to kOS instance, allowing for a limited REPL,
- a way to interactively operate KSP from Lisp REPL, leveraging the power of SLIME,
- a KerboL to KerboScript compiler, allowing one to write kOS scripts in a Lisp."
